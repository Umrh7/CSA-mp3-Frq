## 2024 FRQ #3

### This question is about creating a WordChecker class that processes a list of words. The class has two main methods: isWordChain, which checks if each word in the list contains the previous word as a substring, and createList. CreateList deal with some more complex part as If a word in Arraylist starts with the target and is longer than the target, the method leaves the target from the word and adds the resulting substring to a new ArrayList called result. The constructor initializes the class with an ArrayList of words.

### The hard part of this question was using the indexOf method to check if one word is a substring of another. Handling cases, like an empty wordList or a list with only one word, was also tricky. Properly using the substring method in createList and ensuring the loop logic was correct required careful attention.

### Prior experiences that helped included working with ArrayList and string methods. Practicing these concepts in class made it easier to tackle this question.

### Things I learned that helped me:
####   ArrayList methods.
####   String manipulation methods, like indexOf and substring.
