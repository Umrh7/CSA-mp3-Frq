## 2024 FRQ #3

### This question is about creating a WordChecker class that processes a list of words. The class has two main methods: isWordChain, which checks if each word in the list contains the previous word as a substring, and createList, which generates a new list of substrings formed by removing a given target prefix from each word in the original list. The constructor initializes the class with an ArrayList of words.

### The hard part of this question was the use of the indexOf method to check if one word is a substring of another was challenging. Handling edge cases, like an empty wordList or a list with only one word, was also tricky. Properly using the substring method in createList and ensuring the loop logic was correct required careful attention.

#### Thing I leanred for this that are useful were ArrayList and string method.
