## 2024 FRQ #1

###    This question is about a bird feeder and the cahnces of birds or possibly a bear coming to eat from it. There is a 95% chance for birds to come and a 5% chance for a bear to come and finish the food. For the first part, we had to simulate a day with these probabilities and how much food would be left if birds/ bear were to come. The other part included simlating many days and returning the day the bird feeder was empty.

###    Some struggles I faced when coding this solution was creating the random probability of the normal/ abnormal occurences. I had to recall the Math.random formula to create the proper range of numbers so it would match the criteria given. Furthermore, the code was a bit lengthy and confusing to trace after finishsing.

###    We wrote a lot of methods in class that really helped prepare me for this question. Using Math.random occasionally also helped in preparation for this question since we had to create random chances of events happening. The constant FRQ practice was beneficial in more ways than it was not and the question was more or less striaght forward.

###    Things I learned:
####      -the Math.random formula is ingrained in my head,
####      -doings FRQ's in the allocated time,
####      -not complicating things and writing dry code.
