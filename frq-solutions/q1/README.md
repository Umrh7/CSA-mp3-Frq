## 2024 FRQ #1

###    I had an interesting challenge simulating a bird feeder scenario with a 95% chance of birds eating the food and a 5% chance of a bear finishing it. Using Math.random(), I generated probabilities between 1 and 100. If the number was less than 95, it triggered the usual scenario where another random number between 10 and 51 represented the grams of food each bird would eat. This number was then multiplied by the number of birds and subtracted from the current food supply. If the calculated amount exceeded the current food, the current food would be set to zero. If the initial probability was above 95, the current food would be automatically set to zero, simulating the bear scenario.

###    Some struggles I faced when coding this solution was understanding the scenario like first i was confuse but i was able to make connection to my aljebra 2 class unit called probabilty in where i learn 95% is usual accurance and 5% is unusual which clear my understanding of this question. Furthermore, the code was quite lengthy but not hard to write if had enioygh practice with Math.random().

###    The methods we practiced in class were crucial in preparing me for this question. Using Math.random to generate random events was particularly helpful. Regular FRQ practice made the question straightforward.

###    Things I learned that helped me:
####      -the Math.random formula.
####      -doings FRQ's in the class time.
####      -writing codes on paper in class.
