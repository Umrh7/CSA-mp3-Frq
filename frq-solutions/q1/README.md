## 2024 FRQ #1

### This question is about simulating a bird feeder scenario with a 95% chance of birds eating the food and a 5% chance of a bear finishing it. Using Math.random(), I generated probabilities between 1 and 100. If the number was less than 95, it triggered the usual scenario where another random number between 10 and 51 represented the grams of food each bird would eat. This number was then multiplied by the number of birds and subtracted from the current food supply. If the calculated amount exceeded the current food, the current food would be set to zero. If the initial probability was above 95, the current food would be automatically set to zero, simulating the bear scenario.

###    Some struggles I faced when coding this solution included initially understanding the scenario. I was confused at first but was able to make a connection to my Algebra 2 class unit on probability, where I learned that 95% is a usual occurrence and 5% is unusual, which clarified my understanding of this question. Furthermore, the code was quite lengthy but not hard to write if you had enough practice with Math.random() like I have.

###    The methods we practiced in class were crucial in preparing me for this question. Using Math.random to generate random events was particularly helpful. Regular FRQ practice made the question straightforward.

### Things I learned that helped me:
####   The Math.random formula.
####   Doing FRQs in class time.
####   Writing codes on paper in class.
