## 2024 FRQ #4 

### This question was quite intriguing as it challenged me to work with a two-dimensional array of integers using a class structure. I had to implement two methods within the GridPath class, utilizing the Location class to represent positions within the grid. In the first part, I needed to create the getNextLoc(int row, int col) method. This method should return a Location object that represents a neighboring element of the grid at the given row and column. It was essential to ensure that the indices provided are valid and that the specified element isn't the last in the grid. For the second part, I had to implement the sumPath(int row, int col) method. This method calculates and returns the sum of all values on a path through the grid, starting from the given row and column. Again, it was important to ensure valid indices and avoid the last row and column elements.

### Defining the logic to determine what constitutes a "neighbor" was a bit tricky but exciting, as it required a clear understanding of the grid structure. The challenge with the sumPath method was to figure out the path through the grid and sum the values correctly, which required careful thought and planning especally when u have to use class of Location in a Class of gridPath as we never did this before in our class but experience from lot of hand written code really was helpful. 

### This question required a solid grasp of array manipulation, object-oriented programming, and problem-solving skills. Previous experience with two-dimensional arrays and creating classes helped me tackle this problem effectively. Practicing similar problems in class and working on array manipulations were crucial in understanding the requirements and implementing the methods correctly. This question also increase my level to the point think outside of the box because even though I don't remember how to implement class into the class(at least the way this question asking) but I still attempted and it somehow run when I put the code on replit beside a minor mistake.

#### This question required understanding how to implement logic for determining neighbors and paths in the grid is essential.
