## 2024 FRQ #2

### This question is about the Scoreboard class represents a scoreboard for a game between two teams. It tracks the scores of team1 and team2, initialized from the t1. The recordPlay method updates the score based on the current play number, incrementing t1 (score for team1) on odd plays and t2 (score for team2) on even plays. If the score is zero, the play get shifted from current team to other team by team number increment without changing the scores. The getScore method returns the current score in the format "team1 score - team2 score - current team," indicating which team's play it currently is.

###  This question was hard because you have to know the fuction of FIELDS since you had to add the constructor beside the FIELDS they told you to add, in my case it led me to the few minute of thinking on what to add AS the FIELDS, besides that it was easy to code the whole thing. 

### What crucially prepared me for this question was taking the mock exam. The mock exam had a similar question, but at that time, I didn't realize we could add additional FIELDS in the constructor.Then I work ON CLASSES and now it was not even that hard after the practice. 

###    Things I learned that helped me:
####      -the mock exam.
####      -doings FRQ's in the class time.
